<p2>
My parents are Veronica and Javier Murguia. I have two sisters, Catalina and Veronica. I love my family so much but they’re crazy. My mom was born in Juarez, Mexico so most of my life I’ve spent in Juarez. My dad has 6 brothers and 1 sister so Christmas gets crazy. My dads side of the family loves to eat so every time we get together we eat a lot. The middle sister Catalina is in her senior year of college at Emory University. My older sister Vero, is working and in January will start her masters at Baylor University. My  godparents are my my uncle Enrique and my aunt Marilu.

<p3>
My favorite sport is volleyball. Ive been playing since I was 8 years old. I also enjoy playing basketball but not as much as volleyball. Im on the Radford volleyball and basketball team. I also used to be in a volleyball club called El Paso Stars but am no longer in it because it takes up a lot of my time.I am also in a community service group called Interact which is really fun.<a href="https://www.rotary.org/en">Rotary webpage</a>I also love to travel, this past summer I went with my sisters to Paris and Nice. It was a very fun and different trip because it was only my sisters and I. My favorite places I have travelled to are Greece and Costa Rica. Costa Rica was very adventorous and we got to repelling and go white water rafting.
